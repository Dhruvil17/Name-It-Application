Building an app is not only about opening the text editor/IDE and starting to code

The process includes 

💥 Ideating,
💥 Thinking, 
💥 Sketching, 
💥 Making Wire frames and prototypes,
💥 Finalizing the designs, 
💥 Thinking about the app architecture, 
💥 Finalizing the flow, 
💥 Making sequence and flow diagrams, 
💥 Deciding the methods/algorithms to implement
💥 Setting up the dev environment

Always create a Component Architecture Diagram whenever making any React Project or Application

State - State is a piece of data that you might need to save that might change in future.

Props - Prop is a sort of data that we can transfer, transport or communicate from our parent component to our child component.

Old way of declaring State
constructor() 
{
    super();

    this.state = {
        headerText: 'Name It Here',
    };
}

# React Hooks
1. State => useState Hook
2. Lifecycle methods => useEffect Hook

React Hooks basically helps us to use the benefit that Class based components provide us In React
