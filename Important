Building an app is not only about opening the text editor/IDE and starting to code

The process includes 

ğŸ’¥ Ideating,
ğŸ’¥ Thinking, 
ğŸ’¥ Sketching, 
ğŸ’¥ Making Wire frames and prototypes,
ğŸ’¥ Finalizing the designs, 
ğŸ’¥ Thinking about the app architecture, 
ğŸ’¥ Finalizing the flow, 
ğŸ’¥ Making sequence and flow diagrams, 
ğŸ’¥ Deciding the methods/algorithms to implement
ğŸ’¥ Setting up the dev environment

Always create a Component Architecture Diagram whenever making any React Project or Application

State - State is a piece of data that you might need to save that might change in future.

Props - Prop is a sort of data that we can transfer, transport or communicate from our parent component to our child component.

Old way of declaring State
constructor() 
{
    super();

    this.state = {
        headerText: 'Name It Here',
    };
}
